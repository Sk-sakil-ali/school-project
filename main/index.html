   <center><h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
   <p>Pollution is a critical global issue that affects the health of our planet and its inhabitants. It encompasses a wide range of environmental problems caused by the release of harmful substances into the air, water, soil, and even noise pollution. In this article, we will explore various types of pollution, provide examples of each type, discuss potential solutions, and outline measures that must be taken to combat pollution and create a sustainable future for generations to come.</p>

       <h2>TYPES OF POLLUTIONS</h2>
        <p>Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change.
Pollution can take the form of any substance (solid, liquid, or gas) or energy (such as radioactivity, heat, sound, or light) and according to which we can categorise pollution in different types, which are as follow.

        <!--AIR POLLUTION STARTS-->
        <h3>1.AIR POLLUTION</h3>
        <p> Air pollution is the contamination of the Earth's atmosphere with harmful substances, including pollutants such as gases, particulate matter, and biological molecules. Examples of air pollutants include:</p> <br>
